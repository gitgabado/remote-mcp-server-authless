# IATI Datastore FAQs

### Q: Why is my data missing from the Datastore?
**A:** The IATI Datastore includes all IATI data known to the IATI Registry that is version 2.0 or above and conforms to the IATI XML Schema. Files not conforming to the schema are marked as critically invalid in the IATI Validator.

### Q: When is the IATI Datastore updated?
**A:** The Datastore updates dynamically as new data becomes available via the IATI Registry. New files may take up to 24 hours to appear.

### Q: How do I search for a specific phrase or identifier?
**A:** To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks. For example, searching for "rabbit production" will return results containing that exact phrase, whereas searching without quotes will return results containing either "rabbit" or "production".

### Q: How does the IATI Datastore clean IATI data?
**A:** The IATI Datastore indexes and represents data exactly as published, without transformations or added metadata.
